The Example SubVI_LabVIEW directory contains a simple VI similar to one I
created for an internship. I used this VI multiple times within the much
larger body of code that made up an acoustic test suite. It is a simple
example of what I am capable of coding in LabVIEW and generates an array of
values that are spaced evenly on a logarithmic plot--useful in audio
applications, where it is common to plot frequency, sound pressure level, and
speaker drive level on a logarithmic scale.
