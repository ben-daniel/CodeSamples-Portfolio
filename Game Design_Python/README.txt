These Python files make up the core of a GUI-based game that I began to
develop after my first internship. It uses the GUI library which I used in the
internship, so it is analogous to some of the code I wrote, but on a much
smaller scale. It gives a sense of the object-oriented programming style that
I have become familiar with and have enjoyed working in.
