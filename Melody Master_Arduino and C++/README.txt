This code was written to control the UI and LED circuit for my senior design
project. It was developed primarily by myself and one of my group partners.

The system was a PCB that we designed with 132 RGB LEDs, an Arduino, a
microphone, an SD card, and a computer for user interface. The code generated
a menu, received user input, controlled the LED array for various modes,
computed the FFT of the signal sensed by the microphone, and various other
tasks. The main function was written in the Arduino language (essentially
C/C++), and supporting functions were written in C++.
